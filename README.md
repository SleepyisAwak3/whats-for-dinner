### Abstract:
Whats-for-Dinner is a web page that makes the decision for you regarding what you should cook for dinner.

### Context:
I was given 5 days to complete this project. This was the first project where students had to build the website from the ground up. We had the svg and the background image, all of the code was written and tested by me. I am a mod 1 repeater in week 3 of the Turing Program.

### Learning Goals:
The main goal of this project was the create and become more comfortable with HTML, CSS and Javascript. From building and designing with a certain look in mind, it helped challenge and push my technical skills. One of the largest aspects of this project was utilizing the data model to restructure the DOM and display different elements of the data model.

### Wins + Challenges:
- The main challenge had to be using CSS measurement types. With the information of flex box and other techniques I learned last inning, I was able ot not have to hard code based on pixels often. However I did have to discover what worked and looked best. I have many CSS elements that incorporate % and vh but not all of them. In the future I want to exclusively use % or vh, as it does simplify things.

- The main win was with updating the Data Model. The 'favorites' feature incorporates my Data Model and allows me to manipulate the DOM. The concept of manually manipulating the DOM was a struggle and I want to get better at it, I was able to utilize the DOM to display different aspects of my data model and store values that weren't originally there.
